            <div class="left">
                <h1>Flower</h1>
                <p class="b1">A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in
                    flowering plants
                    (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs -
                    sepals
                    that enclose and protect the developing flower. These petals attract pollinators, and reproductive
                    organs that produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants produce gametes...</p>

                <p class="b2">Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer
                    their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various
                    strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of
                    nectar, a food source for pollinators.[1] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with
                    pollinators to be mutually dependent on services they provide to one anotherâ€”in the plant's case, a
                    means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.</p>

                <p class="b3">When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called
                    pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from a different flower of
                    the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on
                    cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another
                    flower on a different individual of the same species.
                </p>

                <p class="b4"> Self-pollination happens in flowers where the
                    stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the
                    flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar
                    and pollen as food for pollinators.[3] Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization
                    (parthenocarpy). After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.
                </p>

                <p class="b5">Flowers have long been appreciated for their beauty and pleasant scents, and also hold
                    cultural significance as religious, ritual, or symbolic objects, or sources of medicine and food.
                </p>

                <h2>Pollination</h2>
                <p class="b6">Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to
                    transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by
                    various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the
                    production of nectar...
                </p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p class="b7">Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the
                    reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from
                    the Latin name of the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was
                    blossom,[4] though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees.[</p>

                <h2>Morphology</h2>
                <p class="b8">The morphology of a flower, or its form and structure,[6] can be considered in two parts:
                    the vegetative part, consisting of non-reproductive structures such as petals; and the reproductive
                    or sexual parts. A stereotypical flower is made up of four kinds of structures attached to the tip
                    of a short stalk or axis, called a receptacle. [</p>

                <p class="b9">Each of these parts or floral organs is arranged in a spiral called a whorl.[7] The four
                    main whorls (starting from the base of the flower or lowest node and working upwards) are the calyx,
                    corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. </p>

                <p class="b10">Together the calyx and corolla make up the non-reproductive part of the flower called the
                    perianth, and in some cases may not be differentiated. If this is the case, then they are described
                    as tepals.</p>

                <h2>Perianth</h2>
                <p class="b11">The sepals, collectively called the calyx, are modified leaves that occur on the
                    outermost whorl of the flower. They are leaf-like, in that they have a broad base, stomata and
                    chlorophyll and may have stipules. </p>

                <p class="b12">Sepals are often waxy and tough, and grow quickly to protect the flower as it develops.
                </p>

                <p class="b13">They may be deciduous, but will more commonly grow on to assist in fruit dispersal. If
                    the calyx is
                    fused it is called gamosepalous.</p>
                <p class="b14">The petals, or corolla, are almost or completely fiberless leaf-like structures that form
                    the innermost whorl of the perianth. </p>
                <p class="b15">They are often delicate and thin and are usually colored, shaped, or scented to encourage
                    pollination. </p>
                <p class="b16">Although similar to leaves in shape, they are more comparable to stamens in that
                    they form almost simultaneously with one another, but their subsequent growth is delayed. If the
                    corolla is fused together it is called sympetalous</p>
                <p class="b17">In general, there is only one type of stamen, but there are plant species where the
                    flowers have two types; a "normal" one and one with anthers that produce sterile pollen meant to
                    attract pollinators.[</p>
